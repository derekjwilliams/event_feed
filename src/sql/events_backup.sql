Plantation Goods: A Material History of American Slavery
Monday February 17, 2025
7:30pm','Annual Frost Lecture with Professor Seth RockmanProfessor of History at Brown UniversityPlantation Goods: A Material History of American SlaveryRockman tells the biggest stories of early American history through the most mundane artifacts: shoes manufactured in Massachusetts for the use of enslaved people in Mississippi, for example, or woolen dresses stitched in Rhode Island for enslaved women in South Carolina to wear. In following these goods from the communities in which they were made to the communities in which they were used, Rockman rethinks the geography of slavery and freedom in the decades between American independence and the Civil War. He poses questions that continue to preoccupy us in the age of the iPhone and fair-trade coffee: what are the moral, ecological, and political relationships linking consumers and producers across long distances? What does it mean to be “complicit"?

	 ('The Price of Metaphor:  Machine Minds and Missteps in Neuroscience','A Lecture by Dr. Sama Ahmed
Professor of Psychology, University of Washington','For centuries, brains have been understood through the lens of the most advanced technology of the time—brains were clocks, telegraphs, hydraulic systems, and computers with both hardware and software components. While these metaphors have been invaluable in advancing scientific inquiry, they also constrain the questions we ask and the conclusions we draw. Yet metaphors are not neutral; they reflect and reinforce the ideologies of their time.In this talk, Dr Sama Ahmed will explore the historical evolution of brain metaphors, from mechanical machines to information processors, alongside the uncomfortable legacies of scientific racism, eugenics, and phrenology. Through examples from contemporary neuroscience, he will critique and celebrate the power of metaphor, and suggest alternate frameworks for understanding the brain''s complexity in ways that could liberate us from historical constraints.Dr. Sama Ahmed is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and a Weill Neurohub term assistant professor at the University of Washington, Seattle. He completed his Ph.D. training in neuroscience at the University of California-San Francisco and his postdoctoral training at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. His research interests span systems neuroscience, cognitive psychology, evolutionary biology, and genetics. Currently, his lab investigates the neurobiology of multitasking as a way to study how nervous systems generate and constrain different behaviors.Sponsored by Global Cultural Studies, CCM, Psych, PHEAL and CFESSL','/e/6359',NULL,'2025-02-14 06:00:00+00','2025-01-24 06:41:49.720326+00','2025-01-24 06:41:49.720326+00','https://d1tvaw2qn8888b.cloudfront.net/cal-ed52fcf0-eb19-42fd-a43e-2619c1428ee8/square.jpg','Eaton Hall | Salem Campus

Assembled in the 1950s—through both acquisitions from ISAC’s excavations at Ptolemais in Libya as part of asystem of partage (or the division of finds) and purchases from the international art market, this group exemplifies the importanceof revisiting artifact and archival collections with new questions, perspectives, technology, and scrutiny. In its didactics and modesof display, the exhibition tackled timely questions of collecting practices, provenience and provenance, archaeology and the artmarket, and authenticity, arguing that museums do not require new artifacts, new acquisitions in order to tell new stories. This talkwill consider the history of this lesser well-known Roman sculpture collection in Chicago—the objects’ creation and use inantiquity, their rediscovery in the modern day, their acquisition by a Chicago museum, and their modern display history, illustratingthe ways in which we can make sense of marbles with divergent histories and the fundamental importance of archaeologicalcontext in telling an object’s story.The lecture is FREE and Open to the PublicFor disability accommodations contact scheduling and events at schedule-info@willamette.eduFor information regarding the lecture, contact Reyna Meyers at rmeyers@willamette.edu or 503-370-6061.','/e/6404',NULL,'2025-02-27 06:00:00+00','2025-01-24 06:41:49.720326+00','2025-01-24 06:41:49.720326+00','https://d1tvaw2qn8888b.cloudfront.net/cal-d5c95298-2866-4314-bf9e-059c7ca34c66/square.jpg','Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center | Salem Campus
